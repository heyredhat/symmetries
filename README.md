# symmetries
symmetry music

usage: python symmetries.py GROUP_NAME POLYPHONY
right now we have: dihedral1, dihedral2, diherdral3, dihedral4, dihedral5, and qubit
POLYPHONY is an integer. beware of setting it too high!
also, stupidly, it will crash if POLYPHONY is > than # of transformations in ensemble

#

Ps. this version is quite sloppy.
